Addis Music

This project is a (minimal) music information management built using React, Redux, Redux-Saga, and Emotion for CSS-in-JS styling. The dashboard allows users to view music statistics, including the total number of songs, artists, albums, genres, and more. The application fetches data from an API and displays it in a clean, responsive layout.

The backend of the Music Management Dashboard is built using Node.js, ExpressJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose. It provides a RESTful API for managing song, artist, album, and genre data.
